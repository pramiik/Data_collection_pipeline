Colleen Hoover exercises her creativity, to depict a contemporary love story, Maybe Someday. The narrative is driven by themes of love, music, love of music and thoroughly modern form of communication.\nShakespeare wrote in Twelfth Night, \u201cIf music be the food of love, play on!\u201d Music is most decidedly the food of love in this novel, and they do indeed play on -- right up until the end.\n\nMaybe Someday was written with a definite target audience in mind. This book will appeal to older teens and young adults, particularly females. For others, it will appear somewhat similar to other love stories that they will have read in the past that deals with love triangles, and the pain, joy and complications that surround relationships. What sets it apart, however, is the unique approach that Colleen Hoover takes.\n\nShe has created a novel that incorporates music as an essential theme while, at the same time, her main male protagonist is deaf. It imbues the story with an interesting angle. The innovative touches in Maybe Someday saves the novel from being formulaic, and it is filled with wonderful emotional expressiveness.

Suffice it to say you won't regret spending a few hours with the Voss family. They're quirky and dysfunctional to a high degree, but it's when secrets get told that the redemption begins. Not every mistake justifies a consequence. Sometimes the only thing it warrants is forgiveness. The Voss family is anything but typical. They live in a repurposed church, recently baptized Dollar Voss. The cancer survivor mother lives in the basement, the father is wedded to the mother's former nurse, the young half-brother isn't allowed to do or eat anything fun, and the eldest siblings are irritatingly perfect. Then, there's Merit. This family is crazy and has so many secrets; their secrets have secrets. Merit Voss collects trophies she hasn't merited and secrets her family urges her to keep. While browsing the neighborhood antique shop for her next award, she finds Sagan. His wit and unapologetic idealism disarm and spark renewed life into her until the discovery that he's unavailable. Merit retreats farther into herself, seeing her family from the sidelines when she discovers a secret that no trophy in the world can correct. Merit decides to destroy the happy family fantasy that she's never been a part of before escaping them behind for good. When her leave plan fails, Merit is obligated to deal with the tremendous consequences of telling the truth and losing the one man she loves. This book was nothing like any other book Colleen has written. It's unconventional, quirky, and completely relatable. This story is the first book of Colleen's that doesn't make you cry. But it still makes you feel so many emotions, just as all of her books do. I love how she always touches on real-life topics that not usually discussed in novels, such as the Syrian War and gender roles/identity. Colleen is brilliant and a pure genius. In every book she writes, she always takes a black and white situation and shows us the shades of gray. A different side of the issue. She has, more than once, it will change the way you look at many things. If she is trying to make the world a better place with her books, then she's on the right path. You are now, closer to a better world. Her mark will most definitely stay on this earth, and many people's heart.

This book is about Lowen Ashleigh, a struggling writer who was on the brink of financial ruin. At this time, she accepted the job offer of a lifetime. It was the husband of bestselling author Verity Crawford who hired her. Jeremy Crawford needed Lowen to complete the remaining books that his wife couldn't finish in the successful series she was writing because of her injury. When Lowen started in the job, she found an unfinished autobiography that Verity never wanted for anyone to read. Because of the bone-chilling admissions in it, Lowen decided to keep the manuscript hidden from Jeremy. Its contents would forever devastate Jeremy. As Lowen develops romantic feelings for Jeremy, she thought he could benefit if he were to read the words of his wife. The horrifying truth that Jeremy read would make it impossible for him to continue loving Verity.
