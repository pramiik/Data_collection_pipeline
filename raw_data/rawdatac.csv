Lily hasn’t always had it easy, but that’s never stopped her from working hard for the life she wants. She’s come a long way from the small town in Maine where she grew up — she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. So when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily’s life suddenly seems almost too good to be true.

Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He’s also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn’t hurt. Lily can’t get him out of her head. But Ryle’s complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his “no dating” rule, she can’t help but wonder what made him that way in the first place.

As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan — her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened.

This is a Summary & Analysis of the original book. Colleen Hoover exercises her creativity, to depict a contemporary love story, Maybe Someday. The narrative is driven by themes of love, music, love of music and thoroughly modern form of communication.
Shakespeare wrote in Twelfth Night, “If music be the food of love, play on!” Music is most decidedly the food of love in this novel, and they do indeed play on -- right up until the end.

Maybe Someday was written with a definite target audience in mind. This book will appeal to older teens and young adults, particularly females. For others, it will appear somewhat similar to other love stories that they will have read in the past that deals with love triangles, and the pain, joy and complications that surround relationships. What sets it apart, however, is the unique approach that Colleen Hoover takes.

She has created a novel that incorporates music as an essential theme while, at the same time, her main male protagonist is deaf. It imbues the story with an interesting angle. The innovative touches in Maybe Someday saves the novel from being formulaic, and it is filled with wonderful emotional expressiveness.

It’s hard to believe how much our lives have changed since we first began our publishing careers. Some of you may have discovered us with our New Adult novels, Fallen Too Far, Slammed, and Beautiful Disaster, but our journeys started long before then. For Abbi, it began with her lifelong love of romance novels, an unforgettable Christmas present from her husband, and the inspiration she drew from the Gulf Coast. For Colleen, it began with her childhood imagination, an Avett Brothers lyric, and a desire to write the kinds of books she wanted to read. For Jamie, it began with a three-ring binder that became the first of twenty-one journals, a bestselling young adult series, and the support of her former high school librarian.

For those who have read and loved our novels, we offer you a glimpse into our lives and careers—both then and now—with photos and videos and a behind-the-scenes look at our 2014 Fall in Love tour. And you’ll also get a sneak peek at what’s coming up from us next.

When Warren has the opportunity to live with a female roommate, he instantly agrees. It could be an exciting change.

Or maybe not.

Especially when that roommate is the cold and seemingly calculating Bridgette. Tensions run high and tempers flare as the two can hardly stand to be in the same room together. But Warren has a theory about Bridgette: anyone who can hate with that much passion should also have the capability to love with that much passion. And he wants to be the one to test this theory.

Will Bridgette find it in herself to warm her heart to Warren and finally learn to love?

Maybe.

Maybe not. (less)",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1416381591l/23587984.jpg,56a15fef-0ebd-4efa-be7e-ba31c26d9309

This is a Summary & Analysis of Confess. Colleen Hoover is a writer who first came to bestsellerdom through the back door of self-publishing. Signs of the author's spunk and energy fill this novel, which is highly readable, funny in all the right places, but also heart-breaking. Readers who value complex character-development and moral ambiguity won't find much to love in Confess, but the novel is a fun and clever story of two very unlucky young people who find redemption in each other.

Confess is romantic story about two young people, Auburn and Owen, who both have difficult pasts they'd like to keep secret. When Owen hires Auburn to work in his art gallery, their immediate attraction is hard to ignore; for the first time in years, they each feel as if they've found someone who understands them. However, the secrets Auburn is hiding means that she has to stay away from Owen, no matter how impossible that seems.

This companion to Confess also includes the following:
• Book Review
• Story Setting Analysis of Confess
• Story elements you may have missed as we decipher the novel
• Details of Characters & Key Character Analysis
• Summary of the text, with some analytical comments interspersed
• Thought Provoking /or Discussion Questions for both Readers & Book Clubs
• Discussion & Analysis of Themes, Symbols…
• And Much More!

It is an original and entertaining romance, filled with quirky characters, surprising secrets and clever plot twists. The idea of ""confession"" is explored at all levels. How much does a confession imply guilt? Are all secrets guilty secrets?

Auburn has started developing feelings for Owen, which is not a good sign for her. Owen also loves her but it becomes necessary to tell her the truth about his past as only a confession can now save their relationship. This can either bring both of them closer or they may part ways forever.
“I could tell her how I know her. Make her realize why I have this overwhelming urge to protect her. But some secrets I’ll take to my grave, and this is definitely one of them.” – Owen Gentry

Ugly Love: When Tate Collins meets airline pilot Miles Archer, it isn’t exactly love at first sight. But there is an undeniable mutual attraction. Once their desires are out in the open, they realize they have the perfect set-up: he doesn’t want love, she doesn’t have time for a relationship, so that just leaves the mind-blowing sex. The arrangement could be seamless, as long as Tate never asks about the past and doesn’t expect a future.

Maybe Someday: Sydney’s perfect life is thrown into disarray when she discovers that her boyfriend is cheating on her, and she finds herself captivated by her mysterious neighbor, Ridge. Sydney can't take her eyes off him or stop listening to the passionate guitar music he plays every evening. As the music swells, they soon find themselves needing each other in unexpected ways.

Maybe Not: Warren needs a roommate. Enter cold, calculating Bridgette. Tensions run high and tempers flare as the two can hardly stand to be in the same room together. But Warren has a theory: anyone who can hate with such passion must also have the capability to love with such passion. Will Bridgette find herself finally able to love?

Suffice it to say you won't regret spending a few hours with the Voss family. They're quirky and dysfunctional to a high degree, but it's when secrets get told that the redemption begins. Not every mistake justifies a consequence. Sometimes the only thing it warrants is forgiveness. The Voss family is anything but typical. They live in a repurposed church, recently baptized Dollar Voss. The cancer survivor mother lives in the basement, the father is wedded to the mother's former nurse, the young half-brother isn't allowed to do or eat anything fun, and the eldest siblings are irritatingly perfect. Then, there's Merit. This family is crazy and has so many secrets; their secrets have secrets. Merit Voss collects trophies she hasn't merited and secrets her family urges her to keep. While browsing the neighborhood antique shop for her next award, she finds Sagan. His wit and unapologetic idealism disarm and spark renewed life into her until the discovery that he's unavailable. Merit retreats farther into herself, seeing her family from the sidelines when she discovers a secret that no trophy in the world can correct. Merit decides to destroy the happy family fantasy that she's never been a part of before escaping them behind for good. When her leave plan fails, Merit is obligated to deal with the tremendous consequences of telling the truth and losing the one man she loves. This book was nothing like any other book Colleen has written. It's unconventional, quirky, and completely relatable. This story is the first book of Colleen's that doesn't make you cry. But it still makes you feel so many emotions, just as all of her books do. I love how she always touches on real-life topics that not usually discussed in novels, such as the Syrian War and gender roles/identity. Colleen is brilliant and a pure genius. In every book she writes, she always takes a black and white situation and shows us the shades of gray. A different side of the issue. She has, more than once, it will change the way you look at many things. If she is trying to make the world a better place with her books, then she's on the right path. You are now, closer to a better world. Her mark will most definitely stay on this earth, and many people's heart.

This book is about Lowen Ashleigh, a struggling writer who was on the brink of financial ruin. At this time, she accepted the job offer of a lifetime. It was the husband of bestselling author Verity Crawford who hired her. Jeremy Crawford needed Lowen to complete the remaining books that his wife couldn't finish in the successful series she was writing because of her injury. When Lowen started in the job, she found an unfinished autobiography that Verity never wanted for anyone to read. Because of the bone-chilling admissions in it, Lowen decided to keep the manuscript hidden from Jeremy. Its contents would forever devastate Jeremy. As Lowen develops romantic feelings for Jeremy, she thought he could benefit if he were to read the words of his wife. The horrifying truth that Jeremy read would make it impossible for him to continue loving Verity.

Après Maybe Someday, voici le deuxième titre de Colleen Hoover publié chez Hugo Roman.

Quand Tate Collins rencontre Miles Archer, elle sait que ce n'est pas le coup de foudre. Et pour cause, le beau pilote n'a de temps que pour les aventures sans lendemain. Ils ne peuvent pourtant pas nier leur attraction mutuelle, aussi immédiate que brûlante.


Alors pourquoi ne pas se laisser séduire, quand le sexe est si bon ? Pas d'attaches, simplement la passion... Leur arrangement semble parfait, tant que Tate accepte de respecter les deux règles de Miles :



Pas de question sur le passé, Ne pas espérer de futur.



Cependant, ils vont vite comprendre que le coeur ne suit pas d'autres règles que les siennes. L'amour, même quand il n'est pas une évidence, sera-t-il plus fort que leurs promesses ?

Mais si les débuts de leur relation ont été idylliques, Sloan sait maintenant qu'Asa est un homme perturbé, aux règles morales très floues. Elle est malheureusement coincée dans cette liaison toxique car Asa a des moyens de pression sur elle : il l'aide à financer la prise en charge de son petit frère handicapé. Cela suffit pour qu'elle accepte cette situation toxique.
En fac, elle va faire la connaissance de Carter. Il a l'air d'un étudiant comme les autres, sauf qu'elle va le retrouver aux côtés d'Asa, associé à ses affaires de trafics. L'intérêt qu'il avait éveillé en elle s'éteint alors aussitôt.
Mais elle va croiser Carter très souvent puisqu'il travaille avec Asa. Qui est vraiment Carter? Il la fascine de plus en plus. Comment va réagir Asa qui voue un amour possessif à Sloan?
Asa, Carter et Sloan évoluent dans une atmosphère de plus en plus trouble et tendue. Quelle issue trouveront-ils à cette dangereuse situation?

The Merry Mistake by Vi Keeland and Penelope Ward

Note to self: Ask Santa for glasses this year. When I accidentally mistook a gorgeous man resting outside my building for a homeless person in need of lunch, we got into it. I’d only been trying to do a good deed around the holidays, but he called me righteous. I called him something far worse. If only I didn’t have to see him again. But fate had other plans.

Finding Perfect by Colleen Hoover

A short story that brings back several of Colleen’s most beloved characters. Told from the point of view of Daniel from Finding Cinderella, readers will finally get the story they’ve been begging for more of. For the best reading experience, make sure you’ve read all three books that come together to make up this heartwarming and fun holiday short story; Finding Cinderella, Hopeless and All Your Perfects.

A Rock Chick Christmas by Kristen Ashley

What's Christmas with the Starks like? Get a peek into the Rock Chick world and how Luke copes with Ava going Christmas gaga and just what he will, and won't, do for his girls during the holidays.

Just Say When by Jill Shalvis

Is the one you can’t seem to have…

Can love conquer all?

The Pact by Elle Kennedy

Thanks to my hectic schedule as a pro hockey player, my girl and I are spending more time apart than together. Luckily, I have a solution—a romantic New Year’s Eve getaway in the mountains, just me and Grace and plenty of sexytimes. Except this blizzard has other ideas...

The Package by K. Bromberg

A surpresa rapidamente cede espaço à conexão, uma afinidade repentina e irresistível que os une, conduzindo-os a uma história que tem tudo que os melhores contos de fada nos dizem: juras de amor, condições predefinidas, uma garota escapando nos momentos finais... como Cinderela, à meia-noite.

Tempos depois, eles se reencontram. E vão perceber, então, que a realidade nem sempre consegue manter a mesma magia dos contos de fada.

Mas quando um segredo imprevisível do passado de um deles vem à tona, o único apoio será um ao outro, e a força de seus sentimentos. Agora, a luz da vida real, em contraste com o escuro do armário onde os dois se encontraram pela primeira vez, é o que vai determinar os próximos passos de Six e Daniel, que, ainda desbravando essa nova realidade, precisarão segurar firme a mão um do outro, respirar fundo e abraçar todas as novas possibilidades.

Determinado a devolver a Six a peça que faltava para completar sua felicidade, Daniel embarca numa jornada dura, mas emocionante, repleta de expectativa e tensão, provando que, no fim, o amor verdadeiro, mesmo à luz do dia, sempre vence.
