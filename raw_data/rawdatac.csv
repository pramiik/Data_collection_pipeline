"Sometimes it is the one who loves you who hurts you the most.

Lily hasn’t always had it easy, but that’s never stopped her from working hard for the life she wants. She’s come a long way from the small town in Maine where she grew up — she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. So when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily’s life suddenly seems almost too good to be true.

Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He’s also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn’t hurt. Lily can’t get him out of her head. But Ryle’s complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his “no dating” rule, she can’t help but wonder what made him that way in the first place.

As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan — her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened.

The only person who hasn’t closed the door on her completely is Ledger Ward, a local bar owner and one of the few remaining links to Kenna’s daughter. But if anyone were to discover how Ledger is slowly becoming an important part of Kenna’s life, both would risk losing the trust of everyone important to them.

(less)","When Tate Collins meets airline pilot Miles Archer, she knows it isn’t love at first sight. They wouldn’t even go so far as to consider themselves friends. The only thing Tate and Miles have in common is an undeniable mutual attraction. Once their desires are out in the open, they realize they have the perfect set-up. He doesn’t want love, she doesn’t have time for love, so that just leaves the sex. Their arrangement could be surprisingly seamless, as long as Tate can stick to the only two rules Miles has for her.

Never ask about the past.
Don’t expect a future.

They think they can handle it, but realize almost immediately they can’t handle it at all.

Hearts get infiltrated.
Promises get broken.
Rules get shattered.
Love gets ugly. (less)","Fallon meets Ben, an aspiring novelist, the day before her scheduled cross-country move.

Jeremy Crawford, husband of bestselling author Verity Crawford, has hired Lowen to complete the remaining books in a successful series his injured wife is unable to finish.

Lowen arrives at the Crawford home, ready to sort through years of Verity's notes and outlines, hoping to find enough material to get her started. What Lowen doesn't expect to uncover in the chaotic office is an unfinished autobiography Verity never intended for anyone to read. Page after page of bone-chilling admissions, including Verity's recollection of what really happened the day her daughter died.

Lowen decides to keep the manuscript hidden from Jeremy, knowing its contents would devastate the already grieving father. But as Lowen's feelings for Jeremy begin to intensify, she recognizes all the ways she could benefit if he were to read his wife's words. After all, no matter how devoted Jeremy is to his injured wife, a truth this horrifying would make it impossible for him to continue to love her. (less)","Maybe Someday: by Colleen Hoover | Summary & Analysis

This is a Summary & Analysis of the original book. Colleen Hoover exercises her creativity, to depict a contemporary love story, Maybe Someday. The narrative is driven by themes of love, music, love of music and thoroughly modern form of communication.
Shakespeare wrote in Twelfth Night, “If music be the food of love, play on!” Music is most decidedly the food of love in this novel, and they do indeed play on -- right up until the end.

Maybe Someday was written with a definite target audience in mind. This book will appeal to older teens and young adults, particularly females. For others, it will appear somewhat similar to other love stories that they will have read in the past that deals with love triangles, and the pain, joy and complications that surround relationships. What sets it apart, however, is the unique approach that Colleen Hoover takes.

She has created a novel that incorporates music as an essential theme while, at the same time, her main male protagonist is deaf. It imbues the story with an interesting angle. The innovative touches in Maybe Someday saves the novel from being formulaic, and it is filled with wonderful emotional expressiveness. (less)","Morgan Grant and her sixteen-year-old daughter, Clara, would like nothing more than to be nothing alike.

Morgan is determined to prevent her daughter from making the same mistakes she did. By getting pregnant and married way too young, Morgan put her own dreams on hold. Clara doesn’t want to follow in her mother’s footsteps. Her predictable mother doesn’t have a spontaneous bone in her body.

With warring personalities and conflicting goals, Morgan and Clara find it increasingly difficult to coexist. The only person who can bring peace to the household is Chris—Morgan’s husband, Clara’s father, and the family anchor. But that peace is shattered when Chris is involved in a tragic and questionable accident. The heartbreaking and long-lasting consequences will reach far beyond just Morgan and Clara.

While struggling to rebuild everything that crashed around them, Morgan finds comfort in the last person she expects to, and Clara turns to the one boy she’s been forbidden to see. With each passing day, new secrets, resentment, and misunderstandings make mother and daughter fall further apart. So far apart, it might be impossible for them to ever fall back together. (less)","Life and a dismal last name are the only two things Beyah Grim's parents ever gave her. After carving her path all on her own, Beyah is well on her way to bigger and better things, thanks to no one but herself.

With only two short months separating her from the future she's built and the past she desperately wants to leave behind, an unexpected death leaves Beyah with no place to go during the interim. Forced to reach out to her last resort, Beyah has to spend the remainder of her summer on a peninsula in Texas with a father she barely knows. Beyah's plan is to keep her head down and let the summer slip by seamlessly, but her new neighbor Samson throws a wrench in that plan.

Samson and Beyah have nothing in common on the surface.

She comes from a life of poverty and neglect; he comes from a family of wealth and privilege. But one thing they do have in common is that they're both drawn to sad things. Which means they're drawn to each other. With an almost immediate connection too intense for them to continue denying, Beyah and Samson agree to stay in the shallow end of a summer fling. What Beyah doesn't realize is that a rip current is coming, and it's about to drag her heart out to sea. (less)","From #1 New York Times bestselling author Colleen Hoover comes a novel that explores life after tragedy and the enduring spirit of love.

It’s hard to believe how much our lives have changed since we first began our publishing careers. Some of you may have discovered us with our New Adult novels, Fallen Too Far, Slammed, and Beautiful Disaster, but our journeys started long before then. For Abbi, it began with her lifelong love of romance novels, an unforgettable Christmas present from her husband, and the inspiration she drew from the Gulf Coast. For Colleen, it began with her childhood imagination, an Avett Brothers lyric, and a desire to write the kinds of books she wanted to read. For Jamie, it began with a three-ring binder that became the first of twenty-one journals, a bestselling young adult series, and the support of her former high school librarian.

For those who have read and loved our novels, we offer you a glimpse into our lives and careers—both then and now—with photos and videos and a behind-the-scenes look at our 2014 Fall in Love tour. And you’ll also get a sneak peek at what’s coming up from us next.

This is a Summary & Analysis of Confess. Colleen Hoover is a writer who first came to bestsellerdom through the back door of self-publishing. Signs of the author's spunk and energy fill this novel, which is highly readable, funny in all the right places, but also heart-breaking. Readers who value complex character-development and moral ambiguity won't find much to love in Confess, but the novel is a fun and clever story of two very unlucky young people who find redemption in each other.

Confess is romantic story about two young people, Auburn and Owen, who both have difficult pasts they'd like to keep secret. When Owen hires Auburn to work in his art gallery, their immediate attraction is hard to ignore; for the first time in years, they each feel as if they've found someone who understands them. However, the secrets Auburn is hiding means that she has to stay away from Owen, no matter how impossible that seems.

This companion to Confess also includes the following:
• Book Review
• Story Setting Analysis of Confess
• Story elements you may have missed as we decipher the novel
• Details of Characters & Key Character Analysis
• Summary of the text, with some analytical comments interspersed

Especially when that roommate is the cold and seemingly calculating Bridgette. Tensions run high and tempers flare as the two can hardly stand to be in the same room together. But Warren has a theory about Bridgette: anyone who can hate with that much passion should also have the capability to love with that much passion. And he wants to be the one to test this theory.

Suffice it to say you won't regret spending a few hours with the Voss family. They're quirky and dysfunctional to a high degree, but it's when secrets get told that the redemption begins. Not every mistake justifies a consequence. Sometimes the only thing it warrants is forgiveness. The Voss family is anything but typical. They live in a repurposed church, recently baptized Dollar Voss. The cancer survivor mother lives in the basement, the father is wedded to the mother's former nurse, the young half-brother isn't allowed to do or eat anything fun, and the eldest siblings are irritatingly perfect. Then, there's Merit. This family is crazy and has so many secrets; their secrets have secrets. Merit Voss collects trophies she hasn't merited and secrets her family urges her to keep. While browsing the neighborhood antique shop for her next award, she finds Sagan. His wit and unapologetic idealism disarm and spark renewed life into her until the discovery that he's unavailable. Merit retreats farther into herself, seeing her family from the sidelines when she discovers a secret that no trophy in the world can correct. Merit decides to destroy the happy family fantasy that she's never been a part of before escaping them behind for good. When her leave plan fails, Merit is obligated to deal with the tremendous consequences of telling the truth and losing the one man she loves. This book was nothing like any other book Colleen has written. It's unconventional, quirky, and completely relatable. This story is the first book of Colleen's that doesn't make you cry. But it still makes you feel so many emotions, just as all of her books do. I love how she always touches on real-life topics that not usually discussed in novels, such as the Syrian War and gender roles/identity. Colleen is brilliant and a pure genius. In every book she writes, she always takes a black and white situation and shows us the shades of gray. A different side of the issue. She has, more than once, it will change the way you look at many things. If she is trying to make the world a better place with her books, then she's on the right path.
